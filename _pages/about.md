👋 Hello! I'm Navaneeth (Navi), a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for technology. I currently work as a Software Engineer with The Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technologies (CREST) at The University of Adelaide.

🎓 I hold a master's degree in cybersecurity from The University of Adelaide, complemented by a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India.

🌐 I am well-versed in various cybersecurity domains, including Web Security, Network Security and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). I regularly practice and sharpen my skills in vulnerability analysis and penetration testing, and have explored frameworks such as NIST CSF and RMF, Essential 8 and ISO 27001 guidelines. These experiences have broadened my understanding of cybersecurity from both technical and managerial perspectives. I also have a strong grasp of software development and can adapt to new technologies quickly, a skill gained through materializing numerous research products across various domains.

✈️ Outside of work, I indulge in my passion for travel, immerse myself in reading, and enjoy swimming. I also explore my creative side as an amateur photographer.
