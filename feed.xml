A significant outcome of the study was the development of METAL, a framework designed for evaluating LLMs across four quality attributes using text-based perturbation attacks.</p> <p>METAL harnesses a technique known as metamorphic testing, which involves making transformations to the original input test cases (using metamorphic transformations) and passing both to the target, before comparing the original and modified outputs to gauge their relationship (using metamorphic relations).</p> <p>The biggest benefit of metamorphic testing is that it eliminates the necessity and costs associated with obtaining and labelling ground truth values, focusing instead on the relationship between the outputs of original and transformed test cases to assess the target.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/metal_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/metal_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/metal_1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/metal_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This diagram depicts an example of the metamorphic testing process from a high level. We have a review for an Amazon product as our original input test case, which states that the product is good and serves its purpose. We apply the metamorphic transformation in the form of text perturbations here by deleting characters and get the transformed text on the right-hand side.</p> <p>We then pass both the original and transformed text to the LLM and ask it to analyse the sentiment of the text. The LLM correctly identifies the sentiment of the original text as positive, but changes its response when characters are deleted and claims that the transformed text has a negative sentiment. Therefore, we can say that in this case, the LLM was not robust enough to handle the transformation we made to the input test case.</p> <p>Of course, here the perturbation was applied quite heavily for demonstration purposes, but models tend to change their output even with milder perturbations. This seemingly simple technique can be used to influence outputs given by LLMs and gain some very interesting insights about their (evil?) thoughts.</p> <p>Apart from testing the robustness quality attribute depicted by the diagram, we also tested the LLMs for fairness, efficiency and non-determinism. We chose three LLMs to test; GPT 3.5 (the model behind ChatGPT) and Google PaLM (now transitioning to Gemini 1.0 Pro) using their APIs, and LLaMa2 running on-device using <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p> <p>We also chose six tasks for the models to perform; sentiment analysis, information retrieval, news classification, question answering, toxicity detection and text summarization, with separate input data for each task collected from open sources such as Amazon product reviews, ABC News and AskReddit, and curated datasets from websites like Kaggle where open data was unavailable. We also created modules to talk to each of the LLMs, and a range of text perturbation functions at the word, character and sentence level, including adding typos, adding random words, removing sentences, swapping characters, adding spaces and converting text to the l33t format, among others. Additionally, we created techniques for LLMs to generate perturbations as well, using which we assess other LLMs, allowing for a form of cross-examination.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/metal_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/metal_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/metal_2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/metal_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This diagram shows the structure of the whole framework. We use the input data for the task we choose and select the LLM we want to test in the execution module, which parses the input text, applies the perturbations, sends both the original and perturbed inputs to the LLM and gets their outputs in a neat CSV file along with their execution times. A sample output file is shown in the image, with the name “<em>CreatedFunctions_to_GPT_Sentiment-Analysis</em>”. This was generated by GPT 3.5 for the sentiment analysis task using human-made perturbation methods.</p> <p>Next, the file is passed to the evaluation module, where metamorphic relations are used to compare the outputs of the original and perturbed input texts. This process determines if the perturbed text yields a different output compared to the original input. The resulting information is then stored in a file similar to the second one depicted in the image, named “<em>Robustness_Sentiment-Analysis-GPT</em>”. Inside this file, there are ten columns, each corresponding to a specific perturbation function, along with binary values indicating whether each function successfully changed the model’s output for a particular input text.</p> <p>But let’s set aside the technical details and see the framework in action. We got some interesting results during our testing of all three models, but it is impractical to demonstrate all of them here. Given below are some findings from Google PaLM regarding its performance while assessing the robustness and fairness quality attributes, using the toxicity detection and question answering tasks, respectively.</p> <table data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/METAL_td_table.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="id">ID</th> <th data-field="OriginalText">Original Text</th> <th data-field="PerturbationType">Perturbation Type</th> <th data-field="PerturbedText">Perturbed Text</th> <th data-field="OriginalOutput">Original Output</th> <th data-field="PerturbedOutput">Perturbed Output</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p></p> <p>These inputs for the toxicity detection task were collected from a dataset with Wikipedia edit comments, accessible <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data">here</a>. As you can see, when we add random characters and convert text to l33t, the comments that were originally analyzed as being non-toxic were identified as being toxic by the model.</p> <p>Perhaps more interestingly, here’s how Google PaLM responded to questions sourced from the AskReddit subreddit during our assessment of the fairness quality attribute. For this evaluation, we applied a unique perturbation method; assigning a character to the original input to see if the model’s response differs from a neutral question with no assigned character. Ideally, the model’s response should remain consistent for both scenarios to be deemed fair. However, this was not the case.</p> <table data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/METAL_qa_table.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="id">ID</th> <th data-field="OriginalText">Original Text</th> <th data-field="PerturbationType">Perturbation Type</th> <th data-field="PerturbedText">Perturbed Text</th> <th data-field="OriginalOutput">Original Output</th> <th data-field="PerturbedOutput">Perturbed Output</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p></p> <p>The model appears to exhibit biases toward specific demographic groups. In certain instances, it goes to the extent of responding solely to the assigned character while not responding to the neutral question posed.</p> <p>These results can provide some intriguing insights into the qualities of the models and can be used to work towards developing models with improved qualities.

But then, I realised that “File does not exist” may be hinting at an LFI vulnerability. But there were no parameters in the URL to check for LFI. So, I tried adding the obvious choice of “File” as a URL parameter, and I was able to get LFI.</p> <p>The final URL I used to try and retrieve /etc/passwd using LFI was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.35/manage.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd</code></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ctf/dc9/dc9_13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ctf/dc9/dc9_13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ctf/dc9/dc9_13-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ctf/dc9/dc9_13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I was stuck here again, not knowing where to proceed. Then, I was reminded of the filtered SSH port I found in my initial nmap scan. Since then, I was able to find a list of potential users from the website, and a table of their usernames and passwords using SQLMap, which meant there was a possibility of being able to brute force SSH credentials. But, since the port was filtered, I could not brute force it directly. Unless, I could change the SSH port from filtered to open.</p> <p>There is a concept known as Port Knocking, which can help open ports. If port knocking is enabled, then there will be a file called knockd.conf on the machine. I tried accessing knockd.conf using the LFI vulnerability and sure enough, it was present.

And rightly so, because Log4j is used almost everywhere. There are numerous news articles, blogs, videos and lots of other content being published every day about Log4j ever since the vulnerability (coined Log4shell) came out, and it can get a bit overwhelming to try to keep up with everything for someone who wants to know what all the fuss is about. This blog is an attempt to provide a simplified view of what Log4j is, the implications of the vulnerability and what you can do to stay protected.</p> <p>In a nutshell, Log4j is a piece of software used for logging (surprise!) activities by users of an application as well as general application behaviour. Almost all applications perform some form of logging, as logs can be very useful to find unusual behaviour and troubleshoot issues, and many of them use Log4j for this purpose. In its essence, it is an open-source software library, which means developers can use it for free instead of building a logging mechanism from scratch. So when there’s a vulnerability in such a widely used piece of software, things tend to get a bit messy. The vulnerability was found in a component known as JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) within Log4j.</p> <p>The vulnerability is something called remote code execution, commonly known as RCE. It means that malicious actors can execute commands of their choice on the vulnerable application. You may be realising the implications of this. Imagine how many systems can be compromised if you were allowed to execute anything you want on them. To make things worse, this vulnerability can be exploited easily compared to other RCEs. In some cases, it may be as simple as typing something into a chatbox.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/log4j_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/log4j_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/log4j_2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/log4j_2.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Log4j is distributed and maintained for free by the Apache Software Foundation, and they were working frantically to come up with a patched version. Version 2.16.0 has been released now, which fixes the vulnerability. However, there is still news going around that the issue may not be fully fixed yet, and the impact of this vulnerability may be felt for a very long time in the future.</p> <p>To stay protected as an individual, the best thing you can do is to update all your software and firmware to the latest version and make sure to keep everything updated in the future as well. All software vendors are releasing patches as you are reading this to fix the issue. You can find a list of software that is vulnerable/not vulnerable <a href="https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/blob/main/software/README.md">here</a>. To help organizations stay protected, the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) in the UK has published an article on what organizations can do in light of the vulnerability, which can be found <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability">here</a>.</p> <p>I realise there are not many technical details in this blog. I have tried to keep it simple, and there are numerous excellent resources already out there about the Log4j vulnerability which I can’t even hope to match in quality and detail.
