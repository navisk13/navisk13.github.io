The internet is an essential commodity for most people in the 21st century, and the number of home networks is rising, especially with many jobs going remote due to the pandemic.

Some people may opt for a wired connection since they have to connect only one device (a single PC or laptop) to the internet, but most people prefer a wireless network so that every member of the family can reap the benefits of the internet on multiple devices at home.

The simplest way to set up a wireless network is to get a wireless router and plug it in. Simple, yes, but it is also the least secure way to access the internet.

A wireless router comes with its own set of security risks which may leave your network potentially vulnerable, leading to higher internet bills, sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized access to your devices, and even termination of your internet connection due to illegal activity.

Your router will come with a pamphlet, containing the default password for devices to connect to the network, along with the IP address (usually 192.168.1.1) and the default credentials to access the admin panel.

The first thing you need to do soon after you’ve connected your router is to log in to the admin panel using the IP address from any of your devices and change the name of the router, also known as the SSID. This is the name anyone who attempts to connect to your network will see.

Router names are set to the manufacturing company’s name by default, and sharing this information is not a good security practice. Avoid renaming it to anything that can be traced back to you (like “John’s WiFi”), but everything else is fair game.

Make sure you change the password to your network too. Most routers require a password with a minimum length of eight characters. Follow best password practices, and choose a secure password that can’t be guessed easily. You’d be surprised at the number of routers with the password set to “12345678”.

It is also mandatory to change the default credentials to the admin panel. All routers made by the same company will likely have the same credentials for the admin panel, so if anyone figures out the company’s name, they can potentially access your admin panel and gain full control over your network.

Okay, you’ve got the bare minimum covered. But, to ensure maximum security, there are a few other precautions you can take. Ensure that all your network traffic is encrypted.

Your router will come with the option to choose the level of encryption you require. Make sure that you set it to WPA2, which is the industry standard right now. Encrypting your traffic is necessary to prevent anyone from capturing data packets from your network and getting access to sensitive information like passwords.

Another precaution you can take is to turn off the wireless router when you’re not at home, or when not in use. Not only will it close any windows of opportunity for malicious hackers to gain access to your network, but it will also help reduce your internet and electricity bills.

Most routers allow you to connect by pressing a button on the back of the router or using a pin instead of a standard password. It is also a good idea to disable these “quick connect” features on your device.

Finally, make sure that the firmware on all your devices, not just the router, is up to date. Sometimes, all that a hacker needs is one flaw on any one of your devices to compromise your entire network. Keeping everything up to date is considered one of the most important security practices to follow. Good luck, and stay safe!
