Joining Wattlecorp as a Junior Penetration Tester is what gave me my first taste of offensive security. Extensively developed my skills in web and network penetration testing here, while gaining knowledge about various aspects of cyber security, rediscovering my love for content writing and growing a national-level community of cyber enthusiasts and professionals.
