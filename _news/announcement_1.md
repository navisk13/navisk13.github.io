Joined one of India's top universities for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Explored many aspects of technology here, including web development, android app development, computer vision, cyber security and machine learning, and also took part in cultural and recreational events. I am truly grateful to Amrita for helping me get out of my shell and giving me the opportunity to create so many memories.
